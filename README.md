A simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator works with a display screen to
show the current expression being inputted as well as the final output.

The output is calculated by using Dijkstra's two-stack algorithm for expression evaluation.
One stack is used to keep track of operations and one stack is used to keep track of operands.
